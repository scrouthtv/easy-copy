Building and installing the binaries:
=============================================
EasyCopy is built by simply calling

		go build .

in the source directory.
Read the buildscript that is delievered with EasyCopy ("build.sh")
for information about how to cross-compile.

Installing shared files:
=============================================

If you have a manpage viewer, copy the two manpages to their respective folders
e. g. easycopy.1 to /usr/local/share/man/man1/
and ec.conf.5 to /usr/local/share/man/man5/

The default configuration file can be left out or copied to a location where it'll
be read by EasyCopy,
e. g. ~/.config/ec.conf

The zsh completion script ("_ec") must be put into a folder that is in zsh's $fpath,
e. g. /usr/local/share/share/zsh/site-functions/

The bash completion script ("ec-completion.bash") must be sourced by bash.
Some distributions have folders that are sourced by default on startup,
e. g. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/
Note, that the files in these directories are named differently though.

The fish completion script ("ec-completion.fish") must be put into fish's completion
folder, by default
~/.config/fish/completions/
