# easy-copy
Aims to provide a user-friendly &amp; fast alternative to cp, mv and rf.

<!-- Put a catching GIF here -->

## Warning
This project is currently under development.
Use it at your own risk. I take zero responsibility for any damage linked to this program in any way.

## Features
 - **No more lockups**: In difference to normal tools, *EasyCopy* forks tasks such as asking the user to overwrite files or searching for source files.
 - **Know what's happening**: A terminal UI shows all current information at one glance, such as progress, speed and remaining time.
 - **No dependencies**: Zero third-party packages are used at any time. This way you can trust *EasyCopy* even when running as `sudo`.
 - **Uses sane defaults**: Recurses into directories without having to add a flag. Checks by default if enough space is available.
 - **Configurable**: *EasyCopy* supports all features `cp` or `mv` has. *EasyCopy* even supports a config file for setting default options.
 - **Blazingly fast**: While adding extra features, *EasyCopy* stays as fast as proven tools by forking second-priority tasks and using Go.
 - **No need to overcomplicate things**: *EasyCopy* does the very same thing as `cp` or `mv` on Unix. 
 - **Modular compilation**: If a very thin executable is wanted, support for different modules can be stripped at compilation.
 - **Support**: *EasyCopy* is developed for and regularly tested on Linux, Windows and macOS.

### Keep that slow drive running
<!-- Threading -->

### Simple and elegant UI
<!-- some gif or so -->

### Zero third-party dependencies
<!-- how many sloc, which go packages are used -->

###  Defaults, differences to coreutils `cp`
There are only some memorable differences:
<!-- ... -->

### Configuration
<!-- show a basic configuration file, time how long it takes to read this -->

### No compromises when copying files
<!-- time the different copy methods -->

### Kept simple
<!-- https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html -->
*EasyCopy* complies to the GNU Coding Standards about Command-Line interfaces. That means that using the cli tools is very intuitive. For example, these are all the same:
```
 ~ ec -fV foo/ bar/
 ~ ec -Vf foo/ bar/
 ~ ec --verbose foo/ bar/ -f
 ~ ec -f --verbose -- foo/ bar/
```

### Modularity
Starting with `v0.4.0`, *EasyCopy* has support for modular compilation. These features can be turned off for safety or performance concerns:
 - **Configuration file**: By default, a configuration file is read and evaluated. Disable this feature at compile-time using `noconfig`.
 - **Colorized output**: The output can be colorized by default. Disable this feature using `nocolor`.
 - **Raw input**: On Linux, the user's answer to a prompt can be read using CGO and the terminal's raw mode. On Windows, the same is achieved through CGO and the `getch()` function. Both implementations are highly experimental. Disable this feature using `goin`.
To compile *EasyCopy* without color and config file support, one would use
```
go build -tags noconfig,nocolor .
```
